<p>Scott Hanselman in his
  <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/72/be-a-better-developer-in-six-months">72nd podcast</a>&nbsp;
  tell about the ways to become a better programmer in six months. He mentions few things:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Read books.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Read good code.&nbsp;</strong> There is a question: "which code is actually good"? Any code that is used by programmers. So any popular open-source projects, like RSS Bandit, datBlog or Subtext. Also, the code that is actually used by a programmers, e.g. Castle Project.</li>
  <li><strong>Talk with the people outside your comfort zone.&nbsp;</strong>Don't sit in the office. Go for a lunch, talk with someone from different company about their development cycle or tools used.</li>
  <li><strong>Find an intern.</strong>&nbsp;Interns bring fresh minds into the team. They have different wider view on the projects you work on.</li><br />
</ol>
<br />
And finally, the most important point: <strong>if you have a goal, write it down</strong>.</p>
