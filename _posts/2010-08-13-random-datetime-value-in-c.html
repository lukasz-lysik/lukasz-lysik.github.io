<p>Recently I needed a function that return random date. I haven't found anything
that meet my needs. I've finally found <a href="http://tawani.blogspot.com/2007/09/how-to-get-random-date-in-c.html">the article</a>
from Tawani's blog which presents rather long function. However, I like to keep
things simple, so I decided to write my own.<br />

<a id="more"></a><a id="more-7"></a><br />
What are the requirements for the function:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has to be as short and simple as possible.</li>
<li>It has to return random date from the given range [dateFrom, dateTo).</li>
<li>The accuracy of one second is sufficient.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>
This is the function I've written:
</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
DateTime RandomDate(Random rand, DateTime dateFrom, DateTime dateTo)
{
    DateTime randDate;

    // Get random day
    int daySpan = (int)dateTo.Subtract(dateFrom).TotalDays;
    int randDays = rand.Next(0, daySpan + 1);
    randDate = dateFrom.AddDays(randDays);

    // Get random second
    int secSpan = Math.Min(24*60*60,(int)dateTo.Subtract(randDate).TotalSeconds);
    int randSecs = rand.Next(0, secSpan + 1);
    return randDate.AddSeconds(randSecs);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The idea is simple: first it adds random day to the start date, and then adds
random seconds to this. It uses `Math.Min` to protect from jumping out of the
range while adding secound.</p>
