<p>Recently I've faced the problem with registering the areas. I added new area
  to my application, but it didn't seem to work. In this article I'll explain how
  does the areas registration work under the hood and then how I solved my problem.</p>

<h3>How to create areas?</h3>

<p>Using Visual Studio it is pretty easy. Just select the project in Solution Explorer,
  right click and select <span class='highlight'><code class='text'>Add > Area...</code></span>. The folder structure is created
  automatically.</p>

<p>Each area has its own class which inherits from <span class='highlight'><code class='text'>AreaRegistration</code></span> class. The
  purpose of this class is to register new routes (you add new controllers which
  will be available using new addresses - the framework has to know about that).
  In this model each area registers its own routes rather than all routes from all
  areas are registered in one place.</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
public class Area1AreaRegistration : AreaRegistration
{
  public override string AreaName
  {
    get { return "Area1"; }
  }

  public override void RegisterArea(AreaRegistrationContext context)
  {
    context.MapRoute(
      "Area1_default",
      "Area1/{controller}/{action}/{id}",
      new { action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional });
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>But shouldn't there be some entry point where areas can plug themselves in? There
  is. If you open <span class='highlight'><code class='text'>Global.asax</code></span> you will notice that there is one line of
  code being automatically added by Visual Studio.</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
public class MvcApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication
{
  protected void Application_Start()
  {
    AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();
    ...
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>How does RegisterAllAreas work?</h3>

<p>Let's look in the source code of <span class='highlight'><code class='text'>AreaRegistration</code></span> class. For this
  we will need to use a decompiler. I recommend my favorite
  <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/">dotPeek from JetBrains</a>. It's
  100% free and it has the same shortcuts as ReSharper.</p>

<p>The method we are interested in is static <span class='highlight'><code class='text'>RegisterAllAreas</code></span> (there are three but actually only one does whole job). </p>

{% highlight csharp %}
  internal static void RegisterAllAreas(
                           RouteCollection routes,
                           IBuildManager buildManager, object state)
  {
    foreach (Type type in TypeCacheUtil.GetFilteredTypesFromAssemblies(
          "MVC-AreaRegistrationTypeCache.xml",
          new Predicate<Type>(AreaRegistration.IsAreaRegistrationType),
          buildManager))
      ((AreaRegistration)Activator.CreateInstance(type))
        .CreateContextAndRegister(routes, state);
  }
{% endhighlight %}

<p>It looks like a work it does is pretty straightforward. First of all it uses
  <span class='highlight'><code class='text'>TypeCacheUtil</code></span> to find assemblies which contain classes that inherit
  from <span class='highlight'><code class='text'>AreaRegistration</code></span> class. The condition is checked in
  <span class='highlight'><code class='text'>AreaRegistration.IsAreaRegistrationType</code></span> (you can also notice that
  the class should have parameterless constructor).</p>

{% highlight csharp %}
private static bool IsAreaRegistrationType(Type type)
{
  if (typeof (AreaRegistration).IsAssignableFrom(type))
    return type.GetConstructor(Type.EmptyTypes) != (ConstructorInfo) null;
  else
    return false;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>What is interesting, the classes which are found are stored in
  <span class='highlight'><code class='text'>MVC-AreaRegistrationTypeCache.xml</code></span> file. The file is located at
  <span class='highlight'><code class='text'>c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Temporary ASP.NET Files\NAME_OF_YOUR_APP\<random>\<random>\UserCache\</code></span>
    (source: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9032087/mvc-controllertypecache-xml-in-mvc">MVC-ControllerTypeCache.xml in MVC</a>). </p>

<p>The next step of the <span class='highlight'><code class='text'>RegisterAllAreas</code></span> method is to create an instance
  of each of these classes and call <span class='highlight'><code class='text'>RegisterArea</code></span> on them. This is the
  method that we overriden in our area and registered its routes.</p>

<h3>Solving the problem</h3>

<p>Let's go back to my initial problem. To remind you: the application wasn't
  registering routes from my new area. The only suspicious place is the xml file
  with cached <span class='highlight'><code class='text'>AreaRegistration</code></span> classes. Caching is very useful when it
  comes to performance tuning of an application, but in the same way it can bring
  many problems. It turned out that my new AreaRegistration class wasn't listed
  there. So I've deleted this file, restarted application and the problem was solved.</p>
